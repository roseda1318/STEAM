I decided to use Git Pages so that I can continue to use this page for my thesis and after graduation. 

This is a static webpage- the goal is to create a site that will hold my thesis deliverable and make it easy to access for later. 

[Link to Active Git Page](https://roseda1318.github.io/STEAM/#)

## To utilize this later
- For ease of access use google docs to link in the projects- that keeps them living and updates automatically
- This was the [template] that the website was built off of.(https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_interior_design&stacked=h)
- [This] is where many of the projects came from. (https://www.instructables.com/)

## Due to this being a living document I am adding notes for next term (when my thesis starts)

- Consider adding a section for valuable research
- you need to create a google doc hub for the curriculum to be housed in and add the links to each week
- more photos will be needed of the projects completed, When you click on the picture and enlarge it, make the text link to the project page in google docs
